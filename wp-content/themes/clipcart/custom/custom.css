/*

IMPORTANT: Make sure to turn "Use the custom.css stylesheet?" option on in your Child 
Theme settings page (under the top level Genesis menu item in your Wordpress dashboard). 

You can use the "custom" class to override *any* CSS declarations contained in the 
style.css file.

For example, if you wish to change the default link color to green, you would add the 
following declarations to this file:

	.custom a, .custom a:visited { color: #090; }	<--- This makes links green
	.custom a:hover { color: #00f; }	<--- This makes links blue when you mouse over them
